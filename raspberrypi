# This code is meant for Raspberry Pi W Zero with Servo Hat. It creates a clock that displays 
# minutes, seconds and a circle of emojis. The arm of emoji circle rotates in every 30 seconds
# randomly.

# Imports the necessary libraries to use
from adafruit_servokit import ServoKit
import time
import random

# Sets the servo driver
kit = ServoKit(channels=8)

# Starts the seconds and minutes variables
seconds = 0
minutes = 

# Sets the position of minutes and seconds to 0 degree
kit.servo[3].angle = 0
kit.servo[1].angle =0

# Makes sure the clock runs
while True:

        # Runs the seconds from 0 to 60
        for i in range(60):

                # Gets in the if statement as long as seconds stays less than 60
                if seconds < 60:

                        # Moves the seconds angle by 3 degrees.
                        kit.servo[3].angle= 3*i
                        time.sleep(1)

                        # Adds one seconds in every second
                        seconds = seconds + 1

                        # If the seconds is 30 or 1 the emoji tongue moves randomly
                        if seconds == 30 or seconds == 1:

                                # MOves the motor

                                time.sleep(random_number)

                        # When seconds become 60, it sets the seconds to 0 and adds one to minutes.
                        seconds = 0
                        minutes = minutes + 1

                        # Moves the minute arm 3 degrees.
                        kit.servo[1].angle = minutes * 3
                        time.sleep(1)

                        # Moves the minutes arm to 0 when minutes get 60
